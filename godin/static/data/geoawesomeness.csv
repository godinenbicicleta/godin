By combining advanced machine learning algorithms and multi-source satellite data, PlanetWatchers delivers an intuitive and robust monitoring and alerting system that provides critical information for natural resource intensive enterprises.",10 to 20,"We leverage cloud computing (AWS) to scale up our processing capabilities, machine learning algorithms for anomalies identifications and GIS tools from ESRI and QGIS. We combine SAR (radar imagery) with optical data (multi-spectral sources). Optical imagery is used for validation and forming a baseline while radar tracks changes over time. It requires machine vision and remote sensing background to understand the source of the signal and the various phenomena in the images over time.",-,"The verticals in which PlanetWatchers is working (forestry, energy, agriculture, mining, etc.) have long suffered from covering large geographic areas without complete, up to date or constant information. The information that was readily available came from small sample areas but did not paint the whole picture of what was going on. We are sure that there are many insights that exist for these large geographic areas but cannot be found due to the large amounts of data that are increasingly becoming available. PlanetWatchers utilizes artificial intelligence so that a large amount of data can be analyzed and used to create and validate our algorithms. Artificial intelligence will be able to tell the user aspects such as the type and location of disturbances earlier than traditional methods to minimize damage to assets.

PlanetWatchers’ core capabilities are in detecting disturbances/changes in natural resource assets in all-weather conditions anywhere on the planet over time. Artificial intelligence is used in the processing and post-processing steps. We are capable of directing the user to the right location and surface the source of the problem we detect. Artificial intelligence is used to train the system to become more efficient over time as more information is run through the algorithms. Artificial intelligence will be able to tell PlanetWatchers and the user exactly what is causing this and where to go to mitigate this damage before it can lead to serious losses.

PlanetWatchers primarily utilizes Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, which is an underutilized resource in the market. The three main advantages of radar are:
1. Weather-independent - Radar can ‘see’ through clouds, haze and at night so a reliable schedule of image acquisition can be scheduled weeks and months in advance.
2. Sensitive to all layers of the object - Depending on the wavelength chosen (this depends on the use cases and satellite source), different aspects of the forest can be monitored from the individual leaves and stems to the canopy structure.
3. Sensitive to moisture - The level of moisture in the leaves or soil, for example, can lead to a variety of insights and inferences that could not be obtained using optical imagery.

PlanetWatchers selects the most suitable data source and plans the image acquisition for the customers. The data sources (radar/optical) are selected depending on the monitoring use cases of the customer. There are multiple parameters that we take into account such as:
- Spatial resolution
- Range of wavelengths
- Polarization
- Revisit time of the satellite
- Angle for change detection
- The minimal object/area we need to detect","PlanetWatchers developed Foresights, a powerful risk management and analytics platform, specifically to help clients manage forestry assets quickly, effectively, and accurately by providing stronger insights and improved identification of areas of new or potential risk. Foresights’ improved platform covers larger geographic areas and delivers results faster and more accurately than traditional project-based companies, traditional inventory methods and off-the-shelf processing tools. 

Geoprocessing divisions as well as the operations, planning, and growth and yield departments in commercial forestry enterprises will benefit greatly from this state-of-the art platform that provides deep visibility on all geographically-distributed forestry assets. Reports identifying locations that require immediate mitigation can be viewed in existing GIS systems and are geolocated for forestry field teams, including offline capabilities for teams operating in remote areas without cellular reception.",Angel investors,2016,"remote sensing,photogrammetry,computer vision,augmented reality"

From discovering your next adventure, planning effectively, navigating on the trail or sharing knowledge and experience with the wider community.

In our urban lives, digital maps power many of our daily interactions and have enabled many of the major established consumer platforms from hotel booking to local business search. Far from the static maps of old, they have become global, dynamic, contextual and real-time data models that are blurring the boundaries between maps and virtual worlds. However, these maps, have been
designed with urban environments in mind and are unable to support many outdoor use cases, and this has been limiting many of the wider applications in outdoor recreation until now.  

Unlike many existing outdoor apps, rather than target a specific niche, transaction type or activity, FATMAP uses mapping technology at the centre of a strategy to develop the destination for the whole market, bringing together consumers, destinations, businesses and brands in to a multi-sided platform.

FATMAP has developed a purpose-built outdoor map platform for the non-urban world. Specifically the 3 dimensional nature of the terrain and critical safety challenges of outdoor environments need a different approach. FATMAP's mapping adapts to the season with summer/winter imagery and season specific reference data and condition information. The platform also supports full offline usage.

High resolution, accurate geographic data required for outdoor use cases is extremely costly on a global scale, so FATMAP pioneered a unique royalty-based model in partnership with the major satellite companies, similar to the way Spotify works with record labels to gain access to the huge amount of data required to build a global outdoor map.

In order to better anticipate how to direct people at hospitals and other healthcare facilities during a flood event, DHH works to identify those facilities most at risk for flooding and damage so that evacuation procedures can begin with as much advance notice as possible.

In 2005, storm surge from Hurricane Katrina contributed to the deaths of 35 nursing home residents who were not evacuated. The devastating Hurricane Katrina had shown Louisiana -- and the world -- how modern infrastructure could fail utterly. Since then, Henry Yennie, Program Manager for Emergency Preparedness at the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals (DHH), and his department have sought software that would enable better preparedness while being affordable on a federal budget. Additionally, Yennie and his department were looking for a solution that didn't require users to become GIS software experts and could be pushed out for planning at both state and local levels. 

DHH uses a system known as GeoSHAPE to assist in generating this valuable visual information. GeoSHAPE — Geospatial capabilities for Security, Humanitarian Assistance, Partner Engagement — is an open-source project designed to enable collaboration on geospatial information. With support from Boundless, a St. Louis-based open and scalable GIS software provider, GeoSHAPE enables both federal and Louisiana state authorities to work together to overlay storm and flooding data over facility map information. Here, the Boundless-supported GIS software, Boundless Exchange, which Yennie’s team implemented as a web service running in users’ browsers, fit the bill precisely.

Boundless Exchange is the foundation of database decision making for DHH as they are now able to take most impacted areas, bring in census data and operational status data and other information into a map, making it useful and dynamic tool. For example, in August 2016, heavy rains — up to two feet over four days in some parts of Louisiana — caused rivers to rise to record levels. DHH was able to identify the hospitals and other facilities in the path of the flood. Aside from rising water, factors such as high temperatures and humidity can also provide cause to evacuate a facility. Hospitals might be able to provide medical necessities on generator power, but will likely be without air conditioning. Maps of affected areas that also display weather information provide an instant visual picture of the situation and allow DHH to focus on high-risk areas.

A grim aftereffect of major flooding — one that’s somewhat specific to the state of Louisiana, where many bury loved ones in above-ground vaults and tombs — is the tendency of caskets to become displaced. While the structures appear sturdy, they’re no match for flood waters and storm surges. Among the tasks the mapping software effort has taken up since Boundless was first used in the department is pinpointing grave disruptions caused by the flooding. 

Also of high importance to the agency was the learning curve involved. In an emergency, the more people who can provide the visualization of location-based information, the better. The ability to construct the maps, without an expert, in a sustainable way is imperative. With support from Boundless Exchange, GeoSHAPE allows DHH emergency preparedness plans to become action in a faster, more efficient manner. When something happens leading up to a hurricane or storm, DHH needs to know how many hospitals and nursing homes are vulnerable and this type of information is best communicated visually. GeoSHAPE is part of the effort to avoid such incidents in the future by providing a visual picture of areas that will be affected by severe flooding. Boundless has given DHH a cost-effective way of getting that data and visualizing it. 

As vital as DHH’s mission is to the citizens of Louisiana, particularly those most vulnerable to severe weather events, the realities of finance still play a role in how this important work gets accomplished. DHH maximized the agency’s investment by selecting an open source project, which allows them to work within budget constraints while still providing vital services. Despite having a high number of emergency incidents that require a state response, there is still very little funding for public health and Boundless’ solutions allow DHH to operate in a cost-effective manner as federal funds are constantly shrinking.

As demonstrated above, the ideal Boundless customer experience is any government agency or commercial enterprise that needs flexibility in the development of their GIS ecosystems and the proper tools to unlock the value of their location-based data, especially those constrained by various financial or systematic requirements, or hindered by their outdated systems. Boundless allows customers to massively scale their infrastructure, bring on more data scientists, and generally get more output from their existing systems and provides the insights and tools for new customers to leverage location data for their specific needs. 

For example, precision agriculture, which aims to uncover more efficient ways to farm and increase crop yield, relies on GPS data to help farmers make informed decisions on seed choice, crop location, and water and fertilizer level. Open source GIS solutions let farmers leverage their location-based data to gain insight without risking unpredictable software costs and frees up valuable resources and increase productivity for farmers. Countless government operations, both local and federal, include location components for which GIS can aid in better planning and decision-making in areas including emergency management, reporting, engineering design, permit tracking, land use planning, and subdivision review. GIS simplifies government operations by identifying significant patterns and relationships within location data and displaying findings in an easy-to-understand map. Transportation logistics present complicated challenges that can be solved with analysis of location-based data. Whether it’s a municipal government conceiving optimal bus and light rail routes, a hospital that wants to provide patients with the fastest route to their facilities at a particular moment, or an oil company planning its pipeline locations, the analysis of location-based data is vital in making informed business decisions. In construction, choosing the appropriate facility site is a highly strategic process that can negatively affect businesses if certain factors aren’t taken into account. Whether the project is a hospital, retail store, or law office, a multitude of location-based data points regarding the population, weather, regulations, and even traffic patterns needs to be analyzed. Open source GIS software is an affordable way to gather, process, and make sense of the layers of data that affect site selection. 

No matter the industry, Boundless provides an ecosystem of geospatial software, analytics, tools, data resources, and learning materials to make better business decisions with geospatial platforms in any location, from the desktop, the web, the cloud, or a mobile device.",Acquired,2012,"location data analytics,location intelligence,mapping,gis,urban planning,human geography"

In the 25% of the world with well-maintained systems there are many times when street addressing just doesn’t work or is not accurate enough.

They partnered with SocialCops to find locations with the greatest impact and reach people who needed clean cooking fuel the most. The goal was to reach the people who need connections most, rather than opening centers in India's wealthy or urban areas. We used a diverse set of data to figure out where to open up each new LPG center so it would have the greatest impact on improving access to clean cooking fuel.

1. We didn’t actually know the location of the existing LPG centers. In one month, 17,000 distributors downloaded our app to submit their location coordinates from the remotest corners of the country.

2. Since sales data only cares about profitability, we knew we had to add external data so we could place centers in the places with the greatest impact. So we pulled data from Access, our data repository, to map population, affluence, infrastructure, LPG penetration, and a host of other data points.

3. 6.4 million data points about LPG penetration, income, population growth, and more were sourced from our data repository. We pulled disparate data about sales, number of consumers and supply, and more from the scattered internal data systems of India's 3 oil companies. We merged and geocoded all this data with Transform, our data cleaning engine.

4. The transformed data were visualized in an interactive dashboard with the state, district, and village-level comparisons, geo-clustering, and the 10 best locations for an LPG center in every district.

Through PMUY, initially, 5 crore BPL households were targeted for providing deposit free LPG connections to BPL households by 31st March 2019. In a record time of 28 months for its launch, PMUY achieved the initial target of providing 5 crores LPG connection to BPL households.

However, Jaime Sánchez-Laulhé founder and CEO of Geoblink thought differently—what these companies really needed was a software capable of providing them with the right data and accurate analysis to do it themselves. This is the gap Geoblink’s platform solves in the market. Geoblink is the Location Intelligence solution that enables professionals from the retail, FMCG and real estate industries take informed decisions about their business strategies.

This competitive business intelligence is what helps these professionals to maximise the efficiency of their store networks, make accurate sales forecasts as well as optimise their distribution, marketing and expansion strategies, among other benefits.

It’s important to mention that when we say location intelligence, we don’t just mean data on where a particular establishment is located. There are many factors that contribute to the success of a business in a certain area. For example, the level of proximity a potential (or current) location has to competitors is crucial to know as a means to follow up on their movements or guide an expansion strategy. Other key location data elements to take into account when evaluating a specific area is the amount of footfall traffic a location receives as well as understanding the true radius of influence a catchment area has. Additionally, the type of potential customer who frequents a particular location will determine their behaviour towards a certain product. Having this kind of information ahead of time is a real game changer for these industries because it allows them tailor their marketing campaigns to really connect with customers in a given zone.

The most innovative aspect of the Geoblink platform is not only its ability to gather all of these different data sources and display them on an easy-to-use interface, but also the predictive capabilities of the platform which allow these professionals to plan out their strategy. That’s the true power behind the concept of Location Intelligence.","Anytime Fitness is an American gym franchise co-founded in 2002 by Dave Mortensen and Chuck Runyon.

Swift’s Piksi Multi, by contrast, retails for $595 with comparable centimeter-level accuracy to competitive products, providing far more accessible solutions for a wide variety of industries. Swift is known as the disruptive brand in the GPS industry as Swift works to lower technology costs and make GNSS more accessible, reliable and accurate for today’s emerging applications.","Swift Navigation’s technologies are an ideal fit to help shape the way that the world travels, works and innovates in the fields of transportation, surveying, robotics and agriculture, to name just a few of the exciting applications. 

Anyone who needs centimeter-accurate localization at a reasonable price fits Swift’s ideal customer profile, but one particularly apt application of Swift’s technology can be observed with Voyage, a company working to create safer, more comfortable and more affordable transportation options—powered by autonomous driving technology—for communities all across North America.

We bring community-generated data, from Google and other review platforms, together with urban planning analyses to develop nuanced understandings of neighborhoods and cities. By directly including the community as co-creators of the city, we are able to shift away from the current paradigm of prescriptive urban solutions and instead build ethical, sustainable cities around solutions derived from understanding communities, their histories, needs, perceptions and use of space.",5 to 10,"ArcGIS, Space Syntax, City78's Perception Surveying Tool (Natural Language Processing (NLP))",Paradigm,"City78 reduces economic and social inefficiencies due to urban spread and lack of participatory planning avenues available to residents. It has been established that the 20th century urban planning practices which championed segregation of uses are largely responsible for a majority of the urban problems faced today (sprawl, greenhouse gas emissions, traffic congestion). However, it is not enough to simply prescribe mixing previously-segregated uses as a solution. Instead, rather that fit people into space, we aim to create spaces that fit the lifestyles people lead, thereby creating and nurturing the organic growth of urban spaces.This approach presents a model for defining and refining urban problems with solutions created by the users of space, thereby creating a two way interaction between the built environment and people who use it. 

Since our approach in querying communities for their wants, needs, and perceptions is novel in the field of urban planning, our team is working hard to not only continue securing city government and real estate development clients but also expand into the NGO and academic fields. Our solutions are informed by a mix of GIS-focused analysis and City78's custom surveying tool, which queries Google, 311 call data, and other community generated data sources and analyses registered reviews, calls, and comments using Natural Language Processing tools (NLP). This tool, which allows us to map out and cluster community perception and use of space at an unprecedented level, differentiates us from our competition and lets us query the community directly, rather than past survey methods.","City78 assisted an NGO which was looking to build a 10-15 acre community center in the greater Washington DC metro area. They had already conducted demographic and real estate assessments and one of their senior members was a chief urban planner in Maryland. The NGO wanted to know the economic sustainability and growth potential of the neighborhoods they had previously scoped ou, and based on this analysis, select potential parcels for purchase. 

At the heart of City78's report were the findings from our perception surveying tool. By querying and analyzing Google reviews and other community-driven data, we were able to map perceptions on topics like walkability, parking, public transportation, commercial offerings, atmosphere, historic and scenic ""feel"", favorite locations and repeat visits. We were also able to cater our surveying tool more specifically to our client's target population, and tracked the types of stores and spaces where reviews were written in Chinese as well as other foreign languages, as well as the rate at which reviews in each language were being registered in each neighborhood. By incorporating these findings with zoning, demographic projection, and other municipal data, we were able to select four potential parcels which met the NGO's needs for purchase.

Our project with the Chinese community center NGO highlights some of the ways our perception surveying tool can be leveraged to generate findings that would be extremely costly otherwise to gather through conventional survey techniques. While our ideal customer are development organizations abroad, in countries with poor government data but whose citizens actively use review platforms and other community- data registration platforms, our team was proud of its ability to deliver in this project based upon nuanced analyses.",Self-Funded,2017,"mapping,gis,urban planning"
